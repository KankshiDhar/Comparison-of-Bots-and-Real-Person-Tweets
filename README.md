# Comparison-of-Bots-and-Real-Person-Tweets

I have collected tweets from a bot and one real person. 
The bot account is @Scimirrorbot. After reviewing the tweets of this account, I realized, that this bot mirrors the behavior of the user 
who follows it. For this assignment, the person who’s tweets I’ve fetched is @AstroKaren since the bot was mirroring her behaviour 
and tweeting about the same subjects as her.
